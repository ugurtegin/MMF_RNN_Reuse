# Reusability report: Predicting spatiotemporal nonlinear dynamics in multimode fibre optics with a recurrent neural network

This repository contains code used for the manuscript title as *Reusability report: Predicting spatiotemporal nonlinear dynamics in multimode fibre optics with a recurrent neural network* by Tegin and Dinc et al. (2021) Nature Machine Intelligence, 1-5.

BPM Notebooks folder contains a time-dependent beam propagation simulation for graded-index multimode fiber. The code is written in Python with the CuPy library to perform GPU parallelized simulations. 

RNN Notebooks folder contains the training and testing procedures of the recurrent neural network used in the manuscript. The training and testing tasks are performed with these codes written in Python with Tensorflow library and Keras API.

This study is arising from the work of *Predicting ultrafast nonlinear dynamics in fibre optics with a recurrent neural network.* Salmela et al. Nat Mach Intell (2021) to further investigate the possibilities on modeling nonlinear dynamics in an optical fibre with a recurrent neural network.
