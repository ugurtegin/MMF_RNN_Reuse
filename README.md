# Reusability report: Predicting spatiotemporal nonlinear dynamics in multimode fibre optics with a recurrent neural network

This repository contains code used for the manuscript title as *Reusability report: Predicting spatiotemporal nonlinear dynamics in multimode fibre optics with a recurrent neural network* by Tegin and Dinc et al. (2020).

BPM Notebooks folder contains a time-dependent beam propagation simulation for graded-index multimode fiber. The code is written in Python with the CuPy library to perform GPU parallelized simulations. 

BPM Notebooks folder contains the numerical decision layer used in the manuscript. Regression and categorization tasks for the studied datasets in the manuscript are performed with these codes written in Python with Tensorflow library and Keras API. Experimentally recorded data is required to run the decision layer code.

Simulation data will be available upon peer reviewed publication.

This study is arising from the work of *Predicting ultrafast nonlinear dynamics in fibre optics with a recurrent neural network.* Salmela et al. Nat Mach Intell (2021) to further investigate the possibilities on modeling nonlinear dynamics in an optical fibre with a recurrent neural network.
